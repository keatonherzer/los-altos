      <p> El Nido Residential Campus: We welcome children and their families and enter into a partnership with them, building on their strengths and identifying their needs. Family involvement throughout the child’s placement is considered paramount for both successful treatment and reintegration of the child into the community. We recognize that each child and each family is unique. Treatment planning is a collaborative team effort that includes the clinician, program supervisor, childcare workers, psychiatrist, family members, Parent Partners and others involved in the life of the child.</p>
      <p> In instances where a child’s family cannot be immediately identified, team members attempt to locate family members who may live out of the area or even out of state. If necessary, additional resources will be used to help find a family member with whom the child can connect and be united with when treatment is completed. Our residential program is designed to reduce stress, stimulation and demands so that the child, with the help of the professional staff and his team, can master the tasks of daily living.</p>
