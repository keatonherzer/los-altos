      <p> We at Los Altos Auxiliary work to enhance the lives of the boys at El Nido, a residential home in Altadena for emotionally and physically abused boys. </p>
      <p>With funds from generous supporters like you, we have been able to help enrich the lives of the residents in meaningful ways: their first on-campus library, computer stations , a silk screening business, and an art center.</p>

      <p> Our more “hands-on” approach includes monthly birthday cupcakes (sometimes a first for the birthday boy) and Target gift cards, homemade blankets that are theirs to keep,  a trip to Disneyland on Christmas Day for those boys who cannot spend the holidays with their families, and Easter bags! </p>
      <p>Our most popular event, a Halloween Carnival, provides the boys with hours of fun, healthy competition, games, and pumpkin decorating.  Most of the boys have never been to this type of event.</p>
